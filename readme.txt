== Description ==
= About =
With this lightweight plugin you can close your website on selected days of the week.

On selected days your website is closed and a landing page is displayed.

When to use:

* Close webshop during your holiday

Main difference between this plugin and similar plugins is that you can select certain days instead of just closing your website.

= How to use =
After installation go to the settings page. This page is located at Settings > Website closed.

Select days and customize the landing page that is displayed when website is closed.

= Styling =
Custom styling of the landing page via page Additional CSS of the Customizer is being ignored. But you can add custom styling via the settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The plugin will use the website language, set in Settings > General.

If translations are not available in the selected language, English will be used.

Yes, this is possible. Plugin has a preview feature.

= Where to find the image ID? =
Every image contains an unique ID. You will find this ID when hovering the image title in the media library of your dashboard (list view) or when editing the image.

It's the number that comes after: `post=` or `item=`

= Is SEO taken into account? =
Yes, when plugin is active it adds a 503 Service Unavailable server error response code. This tells search engines that your site is (temporary) down.
